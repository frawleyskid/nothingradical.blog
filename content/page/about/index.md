Thanks for stopping by!

I’m Frawley! I’m a queer and neurodivergent non-binary person, and I go by
they/them pronouns. I use this blog to share thoughts on issues that are
important to me—mostly queer issues and neurodiversity.

I call myself bi, gay, aro, ace, quoiro, and maybe other things depending on
how I'm feeling. I consider my orientation to be queer, and beyond that the
labels aren't too important to me. I'm also non-monogamous and a relationship
anarchist.

As for my neurodivergence, I’m anxious and autistic. Please don’t tell me I
have “mild” autism—my autism is actually quite spicy.

I also run [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt), a project to build an online
archive for preserving asexual history.
