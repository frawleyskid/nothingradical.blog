Hey, I’m Frawley! I’m a queer and neurodivergent non-binary person, and I go by
they/them pronouns. I use this blog to share thoughts on issues that are
important to me—mostly queer issues and neurodiversity.

I’m asexual and aromantic, although if you’re queer I might tell you I’m
actually quoiromantic. I’m also polyamorous and a relationship anarchist.

As for my neurodivergence, I’m anxious and autistic. Please don’t tell me I
have “mild” autism—my autism is actually quite spicy.

I also run [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt), a project to build an online
archive for preserving asexual history.

If you want to shoot me a message to make a suggestion, ask a question, leave a
comment, or get it touch for any other reason, you can email me at:
