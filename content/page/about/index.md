Hey, I’m Frawley! I’m a queer and neurodivergent nonbinary person, and I go by
they/them pronouns. I use this blog to share thoughts on issues that are
important to me—mostly queer issues and neurodiversity.

I call myself aro, ace, bi, gay, quoiro, or maybe other things depending on how
I'm feeling. I consider my orientation to be queer, and beyond that the labels
aren't too important to me. I'm also nonmonogamous and a relationship anarchist.

As for my neurodivergence, I’m autistic and bipolar. Please don’t tell me I have
“mild” autism—my autism is actually *quite* spicy.

I also run [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt), an online archive of asexual
and aromantic history.

If you want to shoot me a message to make a suggestion, ask a question, leave a
comment, or get it touch for any other reason, you can email me at
<frawley@nothingradical.blog>. I love hearing from folks, so don't hesitate to
reach out!

If you find this site inaccessible or difficult to use, please contact me [by
email](mailto:frawley@nothingradical.blog) or by [opening an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/frawleyskid/nothingradical.blog/issues/new)
(whichever is easiest for you) and I'll get it fixed.
