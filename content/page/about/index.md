Hey, I’m Frawley! I’m a queer and neurodivergent non-binary person, and I go by
they/them pronouns. I use this blog to share thoughts on issues that are
important to me—mostly queer issues and neurodiversity.

I call myself aro, ace, bi, gay, quoiro, or maybe other things depending on how
I'm feeling. I consider my orientation to be queer, and beyond that the labels
aren't too important to me. I'm also non-monogamous and a relationship
anarchist.

As for my neurodivergence, I’m anxious, autistic, and other things as well.
Please don’t tell me I have “mild” autism—my autism is actually *quite* spicy.

I also run [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt), a project to build an online
archive for preserving asexual history.

I'm a software engineer by day, which is why I spend more time tweaking this
site than I do actually writing content for it.

On that note, if you find this site inaccessible or difficult to use, please
contact me [by email](mailto://frawley@nothingradical.blog) or by [opening an
issue on GitHub](https://github.com/frawleyskid/nothingradical.blog/issues/new)
(whichever is easiest for you) and I'll get it fixed.

If you want to shoot me a message to make a suggestion, ask a question, leave a
comment, or get it touch for any other reason, you can email me at:
