*This post was written for the [October 2021 Carnival of
Aros](https://violetemeraldx.wordpress.com/2021/10/01/carnival-of-aros-october-2021-call-for-submissions-friendship/),
where the theme is "Friendship."*

Early on in my journey to understand my aspec identity, I came across the
concept of queerplatonic relationships. As a baby aro, I found the concept of a
relationship that is committed and intimate while also being wholly platonic
incredibly liberating. Because of social programming, the thought that I could
have intimacy and affection in a relationship without romance and sex had never
occurred to me. I immediately knew that a QPR is something I wanted, and this
started the long process of unlearning many of the social scripts I grew up
with. As this process of deprogramming progressed and I opened my mind to what
an interpersonal relationship is and what it can be, I eventually settled on
relationship anarchy as the primary conceptualization scheme through which I
understand the relationships in my life. However, as I began navigating
relationships through the lens of relationship anarchy, the concept of a
queerplatonic relationship started to become less and less intuitive to me, and
I began to realize that the concept doesn't necessarily map well to my
conceptual model of relationships.

Many relationship anarchists choose to eschew labels in their relationships, as
they consider labels to be a form of classification and classification a form
of hierarchy. My approach to relationship anarchy has always been that I'm fine
with labels as long as they're *descriptive* as opposed to *prescriptive*,
meaning that the label should describe the relationship rather than determine
the boundaries and expectation of the relationship. Traditionally, people
choose how they want to classify their relationship first and allow society to
prescribe what relationships of that type should entail. I prefer to pick and
choose what I want my relationships to entail independent of existing social
scripts—using tools like the *relationship smorgasbord*—and *then* choose how
we want to label it.

One would think that the concept of a queerplatonic relationship would be
well-suited to this style of relationship anarchy; QPRs don't really have any
social scripts associated with them, both because the concept isn't
particularly mainstream and because the definition is vague and fuzzy by
design. This means that "queerplatonic" can be adopted as a label for a
relationship under relationship anarchy without prescribing anything about the
nature of the relationship, and it can potentially be applicable to a wide
variety of non-normative relationship styles. Despite this, lately I've been
finding that "queerplatonic"—even as a descriptive label—isn't as helpful of a
conceptualization for me as it once was.

Since I don't limit the amount of intimacy or kinds of commitments which are
included in a relationship by how I classify it, the only concrete
differentiator for me is the label we use to describe it. Still, for me,
determining whether to label a relationship as a friendship or a QPR can become
a sticking point because it's hard to escape the notion that there's some form
of hierarchy there. While people in aspec communities do generally make an
effort to clarify that a QPR isn't necessarily "more than" a friendship and
"less than" a romantic relationship, it's difficult to completely escape this
narrative when queerplatonic relationships are typically defined in terms of
what they include that a friendship doesn't and what they do not include which
a romantic relationship does. There's also generally an understanding that QPRs
progress *from* close friendships, implying that it's a sort of evolution or
progression from a "standard" friendship. I always see QPRs defined as
"transcending" friendship or going "beyond" friendship and usually as having
*more* of something—like intimacy or commitment—than a friendship. It's
incredibly difficult for me to determine exactly when a friendship should be
"upgraded" to a QPR, because I don't measure the relationships in my life on a
linear scale of "closeness," and to me, there are many different kinds of
intimacy and commitment.

One appeal of the "queerplatonic" label for me—along with terms like
"partner"—is that it provides some social legitimacy for the relationship.
Something I've found I enjoy in relationships is presenting as someone's
partner in a social sense—having our relationship recognized and fulfilling the
social role of a partner. I want the depth of my relationships to be recognized
by others, and calling someone my "friend" generally causes people to assume
there's an upper limit to how deep and intimate the relationship can be. Even
though the term "queerplatonic" isn't commonly understood outside queer
communities, having a formal label for the relationship and distinct language
for how I refer to that person goes a long way toward giving my relationship
social legitimacy. My thinking is that if I can't make other people understand
the nuanced and unique relationships I have with each of the people in my life,
I can at least pander to the rigid classification system they do understand to
gain some social recognition.

Still, I feel like this approach of pandering to relationship hierarchies isn't
how I want to go about relationships. If we go back to [the post where the term
"queerplatonic" was first proposed](https://kaz.dreamwidth.org/238564.html),
Kaz talks about eir feelings toward relationship hierarchies:

> ALSO, I worry that by calling my relationship and desired relationship "in
> between friendship and romance" (which again feels a bit like I'm boxing it
> in) I'm trying to get relationship points from the hierarchy - that because I
> don't want what I have with my not!GF to be dismissed as "just" friendship
> I'm calling it sort of romantic ish in a way in order to get some of the
> importance that gets accorded to romantic relationships in our society - when
> really I should be trying to break down the hierarchy altogether, point out
> that friendship doesn't have to be "just", and that there are more options
> than friendship or romance.

This stance really resonates with me; using "queerplatonic" to legitimize my
relationships feels like what Kaz describes as "trying to get relationship
points from the hierarchy." I want people to recognize that my relationships
are valuable to me, but I don't want to have to impose a hierarchy them to do
it. Unlike Kaz, however, I don't think "queerplatonic" solves this problem for
me. To me, labeling a relationship as "queerplatonic" kinda *does* feel like
saying it's "in between" friendship and romance. As much as aspec people insist
that this isn't the case, the common messaging around "queerplatonic" still
gives me the impression that a QPR is in some way "more than" a friendship.
Even if I could conceptualize QPRs as a distinct relationship category with no
implied hierarchy, I'm still not sure "queerplatonic" would be a useful concept
for me; my relationships are too varied and nuanced to fit into a binary, so
trying to fit them into a ternary isn't really much easier.

I've always hated the notion that friendship is inherently less valuable than
other kinds of relationships, which is why I dislike phrases like "just
friends" and "only friends." Instead of using "queerplatonic" to legitimize my
friendships, maybe I should focus more on defending the validity of intimate
and committed friendships. Because to me, friendship is something special.
There's something delightfully subversive about labeling my intimate and
committed relationships as friendships, like I'm challenging the commonly held
notions of what a friendship is and what it can be. It almost feels like I'm
reappropriating "friendship" from an amatonormative society to mean what *I*
want it to mean.

None of this is intended to be a criticism of relationship hierarchies or the
concept of queerplatonic relationships. Rather, this is more of a personal
reflection on my struggle to reconcile "queerplatonic"—a concept I once found
incredibly useful—with my tendencies toward relationship anarchy. I don't think
"queerplatonic" is necessarily incompatible with relationship anarchy or that
relationship anarchy is necessarily a better approach to relationships than any
other, and I do think that the existence of the term is a net positive. I just
feel like as my personal attitudes toward relationships have evolved, I'm
moving past the need for "queerplatonic."

At one point, the concept of queerplatonic relationships was incredibly useful
for expanding my conceptual model of relationships; "queerplatonic" gave me
permission to seek out the kinds of relationships I've always wanted but never
thought I could have. However, in retrospect, I was just trading one
hierarchical classification system for a slightly less restrictive one. I now
realize that I don't need to classify my friendships as queerplatonic for them
to be intimate and committed, and all the term did for me was force me to
impose a binary on my platonic relationships where there didn't need to be one.
I do see appeal in the term for socially legitimizing my relationships, but
lately my attitude has been that I would prefer to challenge the concept of
relationship hierarchies rather than pander to them. I'm glad the term exists
and that people find value in it, but I think I might let go of this
conceptualization scheme moving forwards.
