*Content warning: bipolar disorder, medical trauma, suicide, electroconvulsive
therapy.*

*This review contains spoilers for* Next to Normal *and* One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.

I recently watched a local production of *Next to Normal*, a 2008 musical about
Diana, a mother who has had bipolar disorder for 16 years. I walked out during
the intermission, after the end of the first act. I don't know how the story
ends, and I'm not sure I want to.

The musical was actually quite good. It also don't think it was bad
representation, like I had feared going in. The story of Diana actually
articulates something I've been thinking about ever since I got my diagnosis.

In the opening scene we're introduced to Diana's family. And despite her
complicated family dynamics, she's thriving. She's getting the housework done
and then some, she's initiating and enjoying sex with her husband for the first
time in months, she's staying up until the early hours of the morning just to
see her son get home safely…

She's having a manic episode.

Her husband Dan recognizes the symptoms, and takes her to see her
psychopharmacologist.

Diana starts a new medication regimen. She tries medication after medication,
slowly titrating up and down, the sessions dragging on for weeks, meanwhile each
time she reports to her doctor that her depression and anxiety persist, while
the side effects only get worse. There's a surprisingly hilarious musical number
where they list off all the horrible side effects of the meds commonly
prescribed for bipolar. At the end of the scene, Diana reports that she doesn't
feel anything, she's numb. Her doctor confidently declares: "The patient is
stable."

I chuckled.

This story resonated with me. I have a great deal of frustration and distrust of
the field of psychiatry—not in the sense of distrusting modern medicine, but
because:

1. Prescribing psych meds is more throwing-shit-at-the-wall than it is an exact
   science. That isn't for lack of expertise on the part of doctors—we just
   don't know how these meds work, why these meds work, why they work for some
   people and not others, or how to choose which meds will work best for a given
   person. You just try one drug after the other and hope one of them sticks.
2. The process is agonizingly slow. Titrating up on a new medication takes weeks
   or months. And there's no telling how many drugs you'll have to try before
   you find one that helps, if ever. Meanwhile, you're suffering. It can be
   difficult to see a light at the end of the tunnel.
3. When it comes to bipolar, cessation of symptoms is often your healthcare
   provider's primary goal—not your quality of life. Diana achieved "stability,"
   but at what cost? She couldn't feel anything; she was numb to her emotions.
   No happiness, no joy. I see a lot of bipolar people who report having this
   experience on meds.

That last point in particular is where a lot of the anger comes from. When the
news media reports on a high-profile case of some famous bipolar person having a
breakdown, or even hurting someone, the question is always, "Why weren't they
taking their meds?" As if it's like taking your daily vitamins. In "You Don't
Know," Dan tries to empathize with her, assuring her that he understands, Diana
lashes out—and rightly so—telling him he couldn't possibly understand the pain
she's going through.

These meds are *brutal*. They make you obese and sedated and unable to focus,
they kill your libido, they make you lose your memory, they make your hair fall
out. Lithium can outright kill you if you're not diligent about getting your
blood work done every three months. And as in Diana's case, they often numb your
emotions, robbing you of your happiness. Bipolar people often describe it as
being turned into a zombie.

Diana eventually flushes her meds down the toilet, and I deeply empathize,
because I've been there. In "I Miss the Mountains," she sings about how she
misses the peaks, and even the valleys. Mania is a hell of a drug; it was one of
the most challenging and scary experience of my life, and I miss it every day.
Having the self-confidence I always wanted, having no shortage of energy for
hobbies and personal projects, feeling like I could do anything… I don't judge
her for quitting her meds. People tell you to take your meds, but they don't
know what they're robbing you of. They're also not the ones who have to live
with the side effects.

That being said, mania doesn't just affect you, but the people around you, the
people you love. During her episode, Diana experiences psychosis, and her family
has to deal with the consequences. You take your meds, and unless you're one of
the lucky ones who finds a regimen that works for you (I've been remarkably
lucky in this regard), they can make life a living hell. You don't take your
meds, and you can hurt people. This is the bipolar experience; having to make an
impossible choice about what sacrifices you're willing to make to protect the
people you love. It's not fair.

Eventually Diana faces the consequences of her decision to stop taking her meds:
she tries to end her life. This isn't something medication can always
prevent—these medications are generally much less successful at treating
depression than they are at treating mania—but in Diana's case, this was a risk
she took so she could experience happiness again, and people got hurt because of
it.

While in the hospital, her doctor recommends electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), an
operation in which electric current is passed through the brain to induce a
seizure. It's used as a last-resort intervention for medication-resistant
depression and bipolar disorder, and it commonly results in permanent memory
loss. When the treatment is proposed, Dan and their daughter Natalie are both
horrified, surprised that the the procedure is even still carried out.

However, Diana's doctor eventually convinces Dan, who is required to give his
consent to the procedure in addition to Diana. From there, Dan pressures Diana
into going through with it. This scene in particular was the breaking point for
me. The decisions bipolar people have to make—the sacrifices they have to
make—to protect the people they love. For Diana to have her agency and bodily
autonomy stripped away by her husband and the medical system, pressured to
undergo to a procedure that will change her life in ways nobody can predict.

What are humans besides a collection of memories? When those are gone, what's
left?

Ernest Hemingway once said to his biographer:

> Well, what is the sense of ruining my head and erasing my memory […] It was a
> brilliant cure but we lost the patient.

ECT did not save Hemingway's life.

I left the theater because I didn't want to know what happened next. Would the
ECT "work" and alleviate her symptoms, tacitly condoning it as an effective
method of treatment? If that was going to be the message, I didn't want to stick
around to hear it. Would the ECT leave her lobotomized, her memories gone, a
shell of her former self? I didn't want to bear witness to that, even in
fiction.

Clearly Diana saw the latter outcome as a real possibility. She compares herself
to McMurphy from the classic novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, who is
forcibly lobotomized at the end of the book; a fate portrayed by the book as
worse than death, given how the story ends with the main character murdering him
as an act of mercy.

In the end, Dan convinces her to go through with the procedure. She signs her
life away to protect the people she loves from getting hurt.

My friend held me as I choked back sobs. I left the theater in tears while they
comforted me. I can't recall the last time a piece of media made me cry.

*It's not fair.*
