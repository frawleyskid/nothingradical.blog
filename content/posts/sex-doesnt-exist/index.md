*This post was written for the [October 2023 Carnival of
Aces](https://sildarmillionjournal.wordpress.com/2023/09/28/call-for-submissions-october-2023-carnival-of-aces-asexuality-sex-erotic-contact-and-physical-intimacy/),
where the theme is “Asexuality, Sex, Erotic Contact, and Physical Intimacy.”*

*Content warning: This post discusses sex and kink, though not in graphic
detail.*

When I first came out as ace, I had this specific idea in my mind of what sex
is, and I knew it wasn't for me. It still isn't. So I labeled myself asexual.
Later on, I began to realize there are some forms of sexual play that I *do*
enjoy, and I joined my local kink community as a way to explore them. I've come
to appreciate the kink community for providing a space where explicit
negotiation about expectations and desires and limits is the norm (and, indeed,
mandatory), which makes negotiating play much easier as an asexual person.
There's a strong culture of working together to plan a scene that everyone will
enjoy, without judgement. Nobody looks at me strange for having limits around
certain kinds of sexual contact, and I have in fact met many asexual people in
the community.

Most folks think of sex as this concrete, definable thing, just like I did when
I first came out as ace. But kink challenges that notion. The more experiences
I've had in this community, the more I've come to realize that the distinction
between "sex" and "not sex" is entirely arbitrary. It doesn't exist. You can
probably imagine at least one activity that is definitely sex, and at least one
that is definitely not sex, but there's an infinite field of gray space in
between. A fun thought experiment you can practice is to list decreasingly lewd
acts to try and tease out exactly when sex becomes not-sex. I'll spare my
audience this exercise in the interest of not squicking anyone out, but you
quickly realize how silly it is trying to draw these arbitrary lines.

I eventually came to realize that what makes something "sexual" has a lot more
to do with how you're feeling than what you're doing. It's about the energy and
connection; you can have sexual energy in your dynamic with someone without ever
touching them. I like how Janet W. Hardy and Dossie Easton explain it in their
book *The Ethical Slut*:

Recontextualizing sexuality through this lens, it's perhaps no longer
appropriate to say I'm completely sex-averse, because I do have that sexual
energy in many of the relationship in my life. There are still boundaries to the
kinds of sexual play I'm comfortable with—these relationships might not always
resemble what most people imagine a sexual relationship to look like—but
everyone, kinky or not, has their limits.

This raises the question of what exactly it means for me to be asexual. Because
for a long time, when I've called myself asexual, being sex-averse is what I was
referring to. If we expand our definition of sex to include things I'm not
particularly averse to—as kink as done for me—am I still asexual?

Is having boundaries around certain kinds of sexual contact what makes me
asexual? I hesitate to describe these limits as asexuality because they're also
tied up in my transness and my biochemistry. Should I attribute to asexuality
what could be better explained by gender dysphoria or HRT or meds? Any ace who's
been told their asexuality is the result of a "hormone imbalance" will be quick
to point out that these things are not the same as being asexual.

I find comfort and familiarity in calling myself ace, but I'm left without a
clear definition of what it means to me. Common definitions of asexuality are
predicated on the existence of a cohesive concept of sex and sexuality:
asexuality is not experiencing sexual attraction, or it's not having sexual
desire, or it's not being interested in sex. But if we accept that there's no
good definition of "sex," then how do we define asexuality? If I don't consider
there to be a meaningful distinction between "sexual" and "nonsexual" play, how
can I differentiate between allosexuality and asexuality?

The reason I continue calling myself ace despite all this doubt is the
inescapable feeling that there's something *different* about my relationship
with sex compared to most allo people I've met. Sex is supposed to be this
intense, intimate experience that connects you with someone on a deep level. For
me, it's more of an activity. Getting tied up and having the shit beat out of me
is a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon with a friend. It's a very casual
thing; my favorite scenes are the ones where we're cracking jokes and laughing
the whole time. I don't see sex as the foundation of an intimate relationship so
much as a hobby I share with my friends. In fact, I don't really associate
sexuality with emotional partnership at all; my relationship with my nesting
partner is completely nonsexual, whereas I do have a sexual dynamic with many of
my friends. I don't attach any special emotional weight to physical affection or
who I share it with; affection is something I share freely because it brings me
closer to the people in my life.

The kink community has really expanded my perspective on sex and eroticism. Kink
has helped me explore my sexuality by giving me the tools to work within my
boundaries and negotiate for play that I find enjoyable. Because for me, kink
isn't just about sex or bondage or dominance or pain; it's a framework for
negotiation and consent. It's a core part of my experience of physical intimacy.
My relationship with kink even extends beyond the scope of a particular scene or
encounter: It's the affectionate playfulness between me and my friends. It's the
unapologetic sex-positivity. It's the sense of community.

I don't know what exactly it is that makes me asexual. I don't know how to
disentangle my sexuality from my transness. I don't know what "sexual
attraction" is or if I experience it. And that's okay, because "sex" is an
arbitrary distinction anyways. Sex doesn't exist.
