    I've been thinking a lot lately about what "family" means as an aromantic
    person, especially when family is so fundamentally tied to the concept of
    romantic relationships.

*This post was written for the [April 2023 Carnival of
Aros](https://tabby-shieldmaiden.tumblr.com/post/713444296272101376/april-2023-carnival-of-aros-call-for-submissions),
where the theme is “Family.”*

In the US, our traditional model of family is the *nuclear family*: a husband
and a wife and some number of children. Any other configuration—single parents,
same-gender couples, childfree couples, multigenerational households (despite
being the norm throughout much of the world)—we call "non-traditional." But even
among these "non-traditional" family archetypes, there are still certain
commonalities. Even "non-traditional" families must align closely enough with
prevailing social norms for us to consider them "families" at all.

Conventional narratives about family prescribe a rigid progression of life
milestones people are expected to follow as they transition from being solely a
member of their family of origin to having a family of their own: having a
sexual and romantic partner, cohabitating, getting married, having children, and
so on. Once you deviate far enough from this script, society stops seeing the
people you surround yourself with as a "family"; they're downgraded to "friends"
or "roommates" instead.

There are allowances for "non-traditional" paths to family—being queer, being
divorced, being childfree—but these are always framed as deviations from the
prototypical nuclear family ideal. Exceptions to to the rule. The fact that we
consider these circumstances "non-traditional" in the first place demonstrates
the primacy of the nuclear family in our social fabric.

This strict progression that we're expected to follow in order for our families
to be considered legitimate in the eyes of society is closely aligned with the
"relationship escalator" concept from polyamory discourse: the observation that
in conventional romantic relationships, the relationship is expected to progress
monotonically through a series of stages that represent increasing levels of
commitment. Couples are expected to "ride the escalator" all the way to the top:
marriage.

In this way, we can see how the concept of the nuclear family is closely aligned
with conventional attitudes toward romantic relationships: society prescribes
rigid rules detailing what makes a family or a relationship legitimate. The idea
that marriage is a prerequisite to family, or that partners must cohabitate, or
that partners must be sexually and romantically intimate are examples of how
amatonormative social rules dictate the terms of our families.

This assumption that family is built around a romantic relationship leaves
aromantic people, who often defy conventional relationship norms in their
interpersonal relationships, without a clear path to having a socially
recognized family of their own.

I think a lot about what my home life might look like in the future—that phase
of life where you're expected to "settle down." For me, part of coming out as
aro was realizing that *I* get to choose what this stage of my life looks like,
without bowing to the "traditional" notions of family I was socialized with.
That realization was freeing. But there's also a certain comfort in the nuclear
family archetype, in having a roadmap laid out for you to plan your life by. And
conversely, there's uncertainty and terror in having no well-trodden path to
follow as you navigate major life decisions.

Society is so prescriptive about what defines a family that unlearning those
narratives has been a journey for me. For a long time, "family" was an
unappealing prospect because society had constrained my understanding of what a
family can be, teaching me that monogamous romantic relationships are central to
the concept. This made "family" feel like something society would one day impose
on me rather that something I would actively seek out for myself.

Society fails aromantic people by teaching us that families must look a certain
way and by delegitimizing the family structures we choose for ourselves. Even
the assumption that "family" is a universally shared goal undermines aromantic
people who don't want or need certain kinds of interpersonal connection. Family
is integral to society, but conventional notions of family marginalize people
who don't fit its assumptions.
