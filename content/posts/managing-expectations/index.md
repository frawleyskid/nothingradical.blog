*This post was written for the [June 2023 Carnival of
Aros](https://www.tumblr.com/aspecs-positivity/718989507951755264/carnival-of-aros-june-2023-call-for-action-being),
where the theme is “Being aromantic in an allonormative world.”*

We typically define aromanticism in terms of "romantic attraction," and we think
of allonormativity as the assumption that romantic (and sexual) attraction is a
universally shared experience. As I talk about in ["Confessions of a Former 'SAM
Aro'"](https://nothingradical.blog/2021/09/16/confessions-of-a-former-sam-aro/)
and ["Plotting My Queer Identity on the Convergence-Divergence
Spectrum,"](https://nothingradical.blog/2022/01/18/plotting-my-queer-identity-on-the-convergence-divergence-spectrum/)
this isn't quite how I think about my experience of being aro. Since I don't
find concepts like "romance" and "attraction" intuitive, I prefer to define my
aromanticism in terms of the way I navigate relationships, and I think of
allonormativity as the collection of assumptions our society holds about how we
can relate to one another. These assumptions underpin many of the problems I
face being aromantic in an allonormative world.

One such problem that allonormativity imposes on me is how it complicates
negotiating relationships, particularly with alloromantic people. I consider
myself a relationship anarchist[^1], so for me, relationships require
negotiation; everyone needs to be on the same page about the boundaries and
expectations of the relationship. How emotionally intimate will this
relationship be? How physically intimate will it be? Will it involve certain
kinds of commitments, and if so, which kinds? How will we refer to one another,
and what do those terms mean to us? And so on. Tools like the *relationship
smorgasbord* can help with this:

<strong>Relationship Anarchy Smorgasbord:</strong>

<p>
To form your relationships you and another can pick any number of "items" from
any number of platters. Take a huge helping or just a small scoop. The dish the
two (or more) of you hold is your relationship. Remember you must agree together
on what is in it! No sneaking items in without the other knowing or there will
likely be conflict or disappointment later. Also it's your dish so if you guys
decide to change what you want from the smorgasbord later, that's cool.

I've found that often, alloromantic people come into these kinds of negotiations
with certain preconceptions of how relationships "should" work. They tend to
categorize their relationships as either "romantic" or "platonic," and they have
a set of expectations for what relationships in each bucket involve. Through
this framework, the negotiation is happening implicitly; the boundaries and
expectations of the relationship are inferred from the labels. Relationship
anarchy flips that on its head; the negotiation happens explicitly and upfront,
and the labels come later. RA leans heavily on explicit communication, but for
people who are used to relationships working a certain way, it's very easy to
fall back on implicit communication instead.

In an allonormative world, when you ask someone to be your romantic partner,
there is a whole heap of implicit negotiation happening. You're telling them you
want your relationship to be monogamous, and assuming you're both on the same
page about what constitutes a violation of that exclusivity. You're telling them
you want to be emotionally and sexually intimate with them. You're telling them
you want to refer to one another using terms like "boyfriend" or "girlfriend" or
"partner." You're telling them that you eventually plan to cohabitate with them.
The list goes on.

The problem with negotiating a romantic relationship implicitly like this is
that any aspects of the relationship that aren't negotiated explicitly—anything
that is left unsaid—is assumed to default to this standard prototype of romantic
relationships that allo people carry around in their heads. And this is a
problem for me, because I don't have this intuitive sense of how relationships
are "supposed" to work. Something is left unnegotiated because both people
consider it "obvious," and they only discover weeks or months or years down the
line that they were not on the same page at all.

Alloromantic people have certain expectations of what an intimate relationship
should look like, and a big part of what makes being aromantic in an
allonormative world so difficult for me is that I need to make sure the people I
bring into my life aren't coming into the relationship with the wrong
assumptions, or someone will get hurt.

Lately, I've been tackling this problem by avoiding "dating" and just
negotiating the relationship in my life as friendships instead. I've found it's
often easier to say, "I want a friendship, but with *xyz*" than "I want a
romantic relationships, but without *xyz*." The distinction is unimportant to
me, but it *is* important to many alloromantic people, and I've found that using
the label "friends, but…" helps keep expectations in check.

There's also something delightfully subversive about calling the intimate and
affectionate relationships in my life friendships. I love my friends, and I love
being affectionate with my friends, and I think that should be normalized. I
don't think these things need be reserved for "romantic" relationships.

I enjoy many of the things "romance" is considered to entail—terms of endearment
and physical affection and going on dates—but I've never related to the concept
of "romantic attraction." I still don't have a complete picture of how allo
people experience the thing they call romance, but I can tell that it's very
different from how I experience it, and I don't want that mismatch to result in
hurt feelings and disappointment. So for now, I'm done trying to make "romantic"
relationships work. And I think I'll be content without them, because I have my
friends ❤
