This is my personal blog. This is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site
using the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme.

Commenting is provided by [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/).

This site uses a Netlify-style `_headers` file and `_redirects` file to
configure response headers (including the CSP) and redirect rules for the
hosting provider.

The infrastructure config for the site can be found at
[acearchive/infra](https://github.com/acearchive/infra).
